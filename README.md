#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, MATLAB, C++, Docker, Apache Spark

## Education	
- B.S., Physics | Simon Fraser University (_December 2022_)

## Work Experience
**Data Analyst @ HAVEN IAQ (_September 2022 - October 2023_)**
- Developed a tree-based predictive model using physics-informed feature engineering for event detection in HVAC systems, resulting in a 31% improvement in accuracy over the previous model
- Devised test plans to validate an asset fault-detection engine, leading to a 9% reduction in false 
positive rate and mitigating the risk of future product recalls

**Data Analyst, Co-op @ HAVEN IAQ (_May 2022 - August 2022_)**
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis for evaluating the impact of a new product's mechanical design on temperature, airflow, and pressure sensors
- Utilized PySpark via a local compute cluster to process data from various databases for machine learning pipelines and ad-hoc requests as required by stakeholders

**Research Technician, Co-op @ 4D LABS (_September 2019 - August 2020_)**
- Provided scientists with ad-hoc analyses using microscopy and image-processing techniques
- Implemented an automation system for ingesting client data and storing it to the cloud

## Volunteer Experience
**Data Science Consultant (_January 2023 - Present_)**
- Consulted local non-profit organizations and analyzed historical donor-giving trends, resulting in more efficient advertising campaigns and identification of donors most likely to convert into monthly donors
- Leveraged principal component analysis (PCA) to determine customer segments, distinguishing characteristics of customers who spend larger than the average spend per customer
- Developed comprehensive documentation and provided training to clients on how to effectively utilize and interpret the monitoring dashboards for anomaly detection in transaction data
