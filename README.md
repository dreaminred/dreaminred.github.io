## Education	
- B.S., Physics | Simon Fraser University (_December 2022_)

## Work Experience
**Data Analyst @ HAVEN IAQ (_September 2022 - October 2023_)**
- Designed and built end-to-end data pipelines to automate data preprocessing for machine learning and ad-hoc requests as required by engineers and data scientists
- Implemented real-time dashboards and metrics in Grafana to monitor the data quality of temperature sensors in over 2000+ residential buildings, ensuring pipeline uptimes of 99.9%
- Validated a rule-based anomaly detection engine for detecting faulty sensors, leading to a 9% reduction in false positive rate and mitigating the risk of future product recalls
- Prepared and presented progress reports for the engineering team to the entire company on a weekly basis, promoting transparent communication across multiple departments
- Conducted feasibility studies and successfully identified multiple product development roadmaps
- Authored multiple technical documents to describe and breakdown complex algorithms

**Data Analyst, Co-op @ HAVEN IAQ (_May 2022 - August 2022_)**
- Developed a tree-based predictive model using physics-informed feature engineering for event detection in HVAC systems, resulting in an 18% improvement in accuracy over the previous model
- Utilized optimization techniques to characterize a productâ€™s sensor accuracy based on mechanical design, leading to an 11% reduction in bill of costs

**Research Technician, Co-op @ 4D LABS (_September 2019 - August 2020_)**
- Delivered one-on-one consultation on microscopy imaging techniques and data acquisition to scientists and engineers in a multi-disciplinary setting
- Developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for various scientific processes such as cryogenic sample preparation, ensuring adherence to industry best practices
- Implemented an automation system for ingesting client data and storing it to the cloud

## Volunteer Experience
**Data Science Consultant (_May 2023 - Present_)**
- Consulted local non-profit organizations and analyzed historical donor-giving trends, resulting in more efficient advertising campaigns and identification of donors most likely to convert into recurring donors
- Leveraged principal component analysis (PCA) to determine customer segments, distinguishing characteristics of donors who provide larger than average annual spending per customer
